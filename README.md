- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ArielAzevedo1997
- ğŸ‘€ I'm a Production Engineer and I started my journey learning c++ at university. Years later I felt the need to learn VBA to improve processes in my work and I got really fascinated by programming and decided to learn more in order to become a dev woman.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning Python and SQL and this is just the beginning!
